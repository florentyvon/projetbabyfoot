# projetbabyfoot

Project of connecting through Arduino and Raspberry Pi bar football. Web application running in a NodeJS server using a MongoDB database and Ionic Framework.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Software setup<br/>  
Now we are going to set up all the required software needed to develop and run an Ionic
app smoothly.<br/> 
*Installing Node.js*<br/>  
Since Ionic uses Node.js for its CLI as well as for the build tasks, we will first install it as
follows:<br/>
1. Navigate to https://nodejs.org/. <br/>
Click on the Install button on the homepage and an installer for our OS will automatically be downloaded. <br/>We can also navigate to
https://nodejs.org/download/ and download a specific copy.<br/>  
2. Install Node.js by executing the downloaded installer.<br/> 
To verify that Node.js has been successfully installed, open a new Terminal (*nix systems*) or Command Prompt (Windows systems) and run the following command:<br/>  
node -v<br/> 
v6.10.1 
3. Now execute the following command:<br/>
npm -v<br/>
3.10.10
<br/>
<br/>
*installing Typescript*<br/>
Run the command : <br/>
npm install typescript -g<br/>
Once TypeScript is successfully installed, we can verify it by running this command:<br/>
tsc -v<br/>
message TS6029: Version 1.7.5<br/>
The latest version of TypeScript at the time of release of Ionic 3 is 2.2.2. You may need to
update the version of TSC to 2.2.2 or higher when working with Ionic 3.<br/>
<br/>
*Installing Cordova and Ionic CLI*<br/>
To install the Ionic CLI, run the following command:<br/>
npm install -g ionic cordova<br/>
To verify the install, run the following command:<br/>
cordova -v<br/>
6.4.0<br/>
You can also run this command:<br/>
ionic -v<br/>
2.1.14<br/>
You can run the following command to get the complete information regarding the Ionic setup:<br/>
ionic info<br/>
Your system information:<br/>
Cordova CLI: 6.4.0<br/>
Ionic CLI Version: 2.1.14<br/>
Ionic App Lib Version: 2.1.7<br/>

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
